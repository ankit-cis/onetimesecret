### Service vs. Utility

#### What Makes This a "Service" vs. a Utility?

1. **Service Characteristics**:
   - Stateless (typically)
   - Encapsulates complex logic
   - Provides a consistent interface for interacting with external resources
   - Often represents a domain-specific abstraction
   - Can be easily mocked/tested in isolation

2. **Utility Characteristics**:
   - Pure functions
   - Typically stateless
   - Simple, direct transformations
   - No complex logic or side effects

```typescript
// Service (more robust implementation)
export const WindowService = {
  get(key: string) { /* complex logic */ },
  has(key: string) { /* additional checks */ },
  getMultiple(keys: string[]) { /* aggregation logic */ }
};

// Utility (just a function)
function getSafeWindowProperty(key: string) {
  return window[key];
}
```

#### Why Use a Service in Vue 3?

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   ```typescript
   // Without service
   const language = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.language : 'en';

   // With WindowService
   const language = WindowService.get('language') ?? 'en';
   ```

2. **Testability**
   ```typescript
   // Easy to mock in tests
   jest.mock('./window-service', () => ({
     get: jest.fn().mockReturnValue('test-language')
   }));
   ```

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Consistent interface
   - SSR compatibility
   - Error handling
   - Logging
   - Type safety


### Conclusion

While the WindowService might seem like a utility at first glance, it provides a
more robust, flexible, and type-safe approach to window object interaction. It's
not just about accessing properties, but creating a consistent, testable, and
extensible interface.

The service pattern allows for future enhancements like logging, more complex
retrieval logic, and easier mocking in tests, which a simple utility function
wouldn't easily support.
